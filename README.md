# TTT-ML

- personal project for learning purpose.
- terminal interface for playing tic tac toe.
- I did the minmax algo implementation during week 3 of principles of computing 2 on coursera.
` https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-2/supplement/qMWrV/tttboard-class`
- this time I m trying to code the class taking care of the game and board state by myself as well.
